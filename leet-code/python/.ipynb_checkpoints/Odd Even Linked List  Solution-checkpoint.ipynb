The variables head and odd are the head pointer and tail pointer of one LinkedList we call oddList; the variables evenHead and even are the head pointer and tail pointer of another LinkedList we call evenList. The algorithm traverses the original LinkedList and put the odd nodes into the oddList and the even nodes into the evenList. To traverse a LinkedList we need at least one pointer as an iterator for the current node. But here the pointers odd and even not only serve as the tail pointers but also act as the iterators of the original list."
